This is an unfinished project developed by Jeremy Su, Meet Patel, Minh Nguyen and Bhushan Suwal at the 2016 Tufts Polyhackathon.

The main goal of this project was to create a scheduler for pick-up games for various sports such as Ultimate Frisbee, Soccer, and Basketball. Users would have been able to host and select from pre-existing games.

This repository consists of the latest version made by the group in Android Studio.
